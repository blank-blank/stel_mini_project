Launch a web server with one click

test first: 
Tests are written first to describe the behavior which we should ensure is running through the code


Prerequsites:

aws cli installed and on path
aws cli is configured with api keys in ~/.aws/credentials or scripts are run from an instance with a role to allow creation of ec2 instances
ssh keypair - the launch script is configured to use my keypair called tim_keypair
the MiniProjectSecGroup security group exists




Usage:

git clone https://github.com/blank-blank/stel_mini_project.git
cd stel_mini_project/cloudformation
sh launch_cf_stack.sh mini_project_template.json

Running the launch_cf_stack.sh script will 

Look in the cloudformation/templates directory
Run the Cloudformation template that is given as the first parameter on the command line
Create a stack called miniProjectStack 
Launch an t2.small Ec2 instance with the security group MiniProjectSecGroup security group
The instance is based on an Amazon linux AMI and installs Nginx and a basic index file in the standard location.
The security group will allow 22 and 80 tcp access from anywhere
Post deployment tests are automatically run after the instance is launched.  The instance id is passed to a Python based test script that will test that the server is up and running, it has the right security group, and the webpage says the correct message.
The tests in test/instance_tests.py are meant to be run from on the server instance.  These tests include checking for the installation of Nginx, the presence of an index file, the running of the Nginx service, and the availability of the service from localhost.  These are not auatomated but could be.  They are meant to be run remotely via Ansible.
